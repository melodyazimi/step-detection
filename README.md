## Project Overview
This project involves developing a step detection algorithm in Python by analyzing walking data collected from a smartphone. The goal is to create an algorithm that accurately counts steps and compares its performance with the built-in step count algorithms from an iPhone device.

Data was collected and download from a phone application that returns accelerometer data - providing a acce.csv file after collection is finished. It is timestamped in nanoseconds.
